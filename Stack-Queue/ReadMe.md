# Stacks and Queues
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Stack is a data structure based on first in last out
Queue is a data structure based on first in first out

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Implement stack and queue classes from scratch

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
for the stack and queue i only manipulate the references to add, delete nodes

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Stack and Queue-->
**Stack Functions**
* isEmpty() ---> check if the stack is empty return true or false
* push(new Node) ---> add new node at the top
* pop() ---> delete from the top
* peek() ---> returns the top value
* toString() ---> print data

**Queue Functions**
* isEmpty() ---> check if the queue is empty return true or false
* enqueue(new Node) ---> add new node from the back of the queue
* dequeue() ---> delete from the front of the queue
* peek() ---> returns the front value
