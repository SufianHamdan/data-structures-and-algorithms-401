# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Find the first repeated word in a String.

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
* Write a function that accepts a lengthy string parameter.
* Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return the first word to occur more than once in that provided string.
* Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.
* Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.
* Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
First started out by drawing out the whiteboard then coded out the function, The Big O space is O(1), and the time is O(1).
