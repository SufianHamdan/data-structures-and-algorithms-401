# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write bellow method for the Binary Tree class

**find maximum value**
Arguments: none
Returns: number
Find the maximum value stored in the tree.

[Code](../../main/java/Trees/BinaryTree.java)

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I declared new Integer variable with maxVale name.

I created new function called findMaxVal

I included if statement inside the order functions when we get new node we compare it with last node value if the current node value is bigger than last value we save this value inside the variable


in the function findMax value I returned an Integer that holds the maximum value

big O space is O(1)
big O time is O(n)
